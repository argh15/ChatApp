<p id="description">This cryptocurrency tracking app iOS application (only iPhones) uses MVVM Architecture Combine and CoreData. This app aims to solidify the concepts of SwiftUI and Combine. It uses multi-threading animations, publishers/subscribers, and data persistence and supports dark mode.\nIt was a lot of fun exploring these concepts. I'll be rolling out a new version of this app soon.</p>
